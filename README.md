# CustomIslandsGenerator
**Note:** Saving a savegame with a modded island down forever breaks your savegame. Create a backup before doing anything with this mod.
## How to use:
  1. Download the Shapez 2 mod from the discord. [Link](https://example.com/)
  2. Extract the zip.
  3. Locate your game's root and drag the zip's contents into it.
  4. Start your game and open a save.
  5. Open the [Custom Island Generator](https://waffledevsalt.github.io/CustomIslandsGenerator/)
  6. Generate a Layout, give it a name and a category. (Both names and categorys are unused ingame and will only be used when the modding api is released)
  7. Click export.
  8. Go into your game, click f1, type `layouts.create` and paste the exported layout code.
  9. Go to the Island placement menu, open the "Large" category and place the first Island.
  10. Done.
